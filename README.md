# WeatherPy
UCF Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp: Python API
# Unit 6 | Assignment - What's the Weather Like?

## Background

## WeatherPy

In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Your objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

## Observable Trends

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude -As latitude increases the temperature decreases. 

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude -As latitude increase humidity % varies which support  an in direct correlation. 

* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude- As latitude increases so does cloudiness.

* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude- Windspeeds less than 15mph tend to  vary across latitudes.
